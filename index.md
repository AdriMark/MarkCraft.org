# About MarkCraft

Markcraft is a long term Minecraft Bedrock SMP that has been up for 3 years! We focus on dedicated players within the community and **never** reset our world. Although we are currently looking for content creators, everybody may apply and be considered for the server.

# More Than a Server

Markcraft isn't just a bedrock SMP though, it's also a community. If you're at all interested in Minecraft then there is something here for you, whether that be, survival, servers, content creation, modding, or even art. We encourage all of our members to share their work and build a better bedrock (—) Together.
